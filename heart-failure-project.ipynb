In 2015, the World Health Organisation found that 17.7 million deaths were CVD-related while 633,842 deaths were recorded in the United States alone (1). As CVD-related deaths continue to increase, so does its overall burden on the healthcare system with some estimating its overall burden to cost an estimated \\\\$237 billion, surpassing both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes with projections calculating a estimating the burden of CVD costing $368 billion by the year 2035 (1). Studies have shown that CVD incidence significantly increases with age with some variation between gender (1). This Dataset investigates 11 key features of heart disease across 918 patients (2). This project aims to clean, validate and investigate trends throughout the data to identify correlations that may be used to help develop early detection and treatment strategies for future patients.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing required libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport

The average age of this dataset is 53, suggesting that the sample size consisted primarily of older patients\n\n* Typically the average resting heart blood pressure of a healthy individual is around

Within the data set, the average cholesterol level is significantly higher than in healthy patients. Typically, cholesterol levels of 190 mg/dl or higher are considered very high.\n\n* Max heart rate was the overall maximum heart rate achieved during exercise tests.

This can be explained as women typically survive longer after the onset of heart failure (3).
